Sorting Algorithms.
This is an implementation of the divide and conquer Merge Sort
algorithm. This code was made thanks to an implementation made
by Dr. Marco Heinen, Universidad de Guanajuato.

Instructions:
===============

i) Compiling and running: 

  --------------------------------------------------
  NOTES:
  A <FileName>.txt will be necessary for compilation
  arguments. The file must contain the sorting array
  as a single column. Also number of lines/elements
  in the file. <FileName> will be obtained as double
  presition.
  --------------------------------------------------
  
  1) Compile de Makefile:
     Make
  2) Execute:
     ./../bin/mergesort <FileName.txt> <NofLinesInFile>
 
ii) Details:

The sorted array will be writen in a new file named
'sorted.txt'. Look for file in the same address.
